# Kinematic Character

Example of how to make a kinematic character controller in 2D using
[`KinematicBody2D`](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/classes/class_kinematicbody2d.html).
The character moves around, is affected by moving platforms,
can jump through one-way collision platforms, etc. 

Language: [C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/index.html)

Renderer: GLES 2
